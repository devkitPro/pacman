VERSION         DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.9.5         - bugfix: missing files after re-ordering packages wrt
                deps with --upgrade
              - added "Repository" line to -Si output
              - patch from Tommi Rantala to fix trim() behaviour with
                empty or whitespace-only strings
              - fixed removal order when using -Rc or -Rs
2.9.4         - fixed a bug that was introduced from another bugfix :-/
2.9.3         - fixed a couple manpage typos
              - added --ignore to -S operations, works just like IgnorePkg
              - respect IgnorePkg list when pulling in dependencies
              - numerous memleak fixes
              - some code changes to improve customizability/branding
              - Makefile fix for nonstandard lib search paths (Kevin Piche)
              - fixed the leftover directories in /tmp
              - speed improvement patches from Tommi Rantala
2.9.2         - bugfix for 2.9.1 
2.9.1         - --refresh now only downloads fresh packages lists if they've
                been updated (currently only works with FTP)
2.9           - Improved -Rs functionality -- pacman now tracks why a package
                is installed: explicitly, or as a dependency for another
                package.  -Rs will only remove dependencies that were not
                explicitly installed.
              - Added compressed package size to sync DBs -- shows the total
                size of packages before downloading
              - Patch from Tommi Rantala:
                - Allow --info and --list together in queries
              - Patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Use list_add_sorted() with -Sg
              - Patch from Hegedus Marton Csaba:
                - Better manpage compression
              - Added checks for additional hyphens in package versions
              - mktemp was failing if %pmo_root%/tmp was missing -- fixed
2.8.4         - Added updatesync script from Jason Chu
              - Changed the pacman binary to be dynamically linked
                - Included a pacman.static binary as well
                - Added fakeroot checks when seeing if we're root
              - Fixed makepkg to use 'tail -n 1' instead of 'tail -1'
              - Added patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Cleanup db_loadpkgs(), add list_add_sorted()
              - Fixed a memory leak in db_find_conflicts()
2.8.3         - Fixed a little makepkg bug with bash 3.0
              - Fixed resolvedeps to always prefer literals over provisios
              - Added --config option to specify an alternate config file
              - Added "Include" directive to include repositories from
                config files (inspired by Michael Baehr's patch)
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Even smarter file-conflict checking
2.8.2         - Fixed a segfault bug in file-conflict checks
              - Made --noconfirm actually work.  Go me.
2.8.1         - Added a HoldPkg option in pacman.conf, for the more
                exploratory users who run things like "pacman -R pacman".  It
                will ask for confirmation before removing any packages listed
                in the HoldPkg list
              - Added a --noconfirm switch for use with script automation
              - Modified dependency resolution to prefer packages explicitly
                requested on the cmdline instead of those pulled in by
                resolvedeps().  Example, if neither "xorg" nor "xfree86" is
                installed and "blackbox xfree86" is requested, "xfree86" will
                be used instead of "xorg"
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Smarter file-conflict checking with symlinked paths and
                  with files that move from one package to another
2.8           - Bugfixes:
                - #861:  file:/// urls not handled properly with XferCommand
                - #1003: set umask before scriptlet calls
                - #1027: download problems with http urls using -U/-A
                - #1044: segfaults when using -Rs
                - #863:  "missing post_remove" errors with some packages
                - #875:  detect low disk space properly
                - #986:  makepkg -e doesn't validate files
                - #1010: add -j option to makepkg
                - #1028: make pacman -Sp runnable as non-root
              - added pre_install and pre_upgrade scriptlet support
              - added an "Architecture" field in the package meta-data
              - added patch from Aurelien Foret which improves performance
                adding or removing packages
              - added implementation of GNU's strverscmp function for better
                portability
              - added explicit unlink() calls when --force is used, which
                prevents those nasty "Text file busy" errors when you
                force-upgrade something like pacman or glibc.
2.7.9         - added the "force" option to packages, so --sysupgrade can
                downgrade packages when it needs to
2.7.8         - added post_remove scriptlet support
              - added -Qs option (bug #854)
              - a provisio does not imply conflict, to make a provisio target
                conflict with anything else that provides the same thing, you
                can now do this by specifying the provisio target as both a
                provides and a conflict, eg:
                   conflicts=('x-server')
                   provides=('x-server')
              - cleaned up the download progress bar a bit
              - added %o parameter to XferCommand so wget can resume properly
              - fixed a segfault in downloadfiles() (bug #787)
              - patches from Oliver Burnett-Hall
                - gensync uses a better temp dir (bug #774)
                - PKGDEST can be set in makepkg.conf (bug #783)
              - patches from Aurelien Foret
                - segfault fix, couple memory leaks
                - more sanity checks in "provides" searches
                - fixed a little display bug in the progress bar
                - made -Qip look like -Qi
                - -Sc now removes OLD packages from cache, use -Scc for all
2.7.7         - added an XferCommand directive that will make pacman use an
                external download utility like wget
              - added a license field to package meta-data
              - add url support to -A and -U operations (download packages)
              - -Ss now searches thru provides fields
              - added --dbonly option to -R
2.7.6         - added --print-uris option
              - fixed an http download bug (bug #667)
              - fixed a segfault related to replaces/conflicts handling
2.7.5         - "replaces" packages were ignoring IgnorePkg in pacman.conf
              - fixed another bug in conflict handling
              - found an out-dated reference to /usr/abs, fixed
              - added a --recursive option for package removal, which removes
                all deps of a target that aren't required by other packages
2.7.4         - fixed a bug in conflict handling, where installing a
                conflicting package would fail even if the new package
                "provided" it
              - if pacman sees a newer version of itself during an upgrade,
                it will ask to install itself first, then be re-run to upgrade
                the other packages.
              - You can now use the --info option with --sync to display an
                uninstalled package's dependency info.
              - Added a sane umask before db writes
              - buffer overflow fix (bug #442)
2.7.3         - makepkg not longer strips files with .exe or .dll extensions
              - Added Aurelien's patch:
                - proxy support (no authentication yet)
                - HTTP/1.1 support
                - an improved progress bar with transfer rates and ETA

              - Renamed the "stable" repo to "release" in pacman.conf
              - Renamed the "unofficial" repo to "extra" in pacman.conf

              - Added -Qii handling to show modified config files
              - Allow --sync targets to specify an explicit repository to
                sync from (eg, pacman -S current/patch)

2.6.3         - A couple memory fixes in the new replaces code
2.6.2         - Fixed a memory cleanup bug
              - Aurelien's patch:
                - bug #159 implemented (for -S and -R)
                - fixed a bug with pacman -Sg (pacman was browsing only one
                  db to get groups)
                - fixed a bug with list_merge()
                - fixed some MLK (in dumppkg() and with "-Qi --orphans")
                - now "pacman -Sg" only displays groups (without content)
                  whereas "pacman -Sg target1 target2" displays groups
                  target1 and target2 with content

              - Fixed an argument-passing bug in fakeroot
              - Modified pacman's behaviour wrt provides -- it now allows
                multiple packages to be installed, even if they provide the
                same thing (they were treated as conflicts before)
2.6           - Added group handling, so one can run 'pacman -S kde' and
                install all files from the KDE group
              - Fixed a duplication bug in cascade package removal
              - Added support for virtual provisions with "provides" tags
              - When conflicts are encountered, pacman now offers the chance
                to remove the conflicting packages (provides or literals)
              - Added support for renamed/combined packages with a "replaces"
                tag
              - Added --nostrip option to makepkg

                removed from the cache directory
2.3           - The beginnings of source-side dependency resolution, makepkg
                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
