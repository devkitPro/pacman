Name

makepkg - package build utility


Synopsis
--------
makepkg [options]


Description
-----------
makepkg is a script to automate the building of packages. The requirements for
using the script are a build-capable \*nix platform and a custom build script
for each package you wish to build (known as a PKGBUILD). See
linkman:PKGBUILD[5] for details on creating your own build scripts.

The advantage to a script-based build is that the work is only done once. Once
you have the build script for a package, makepkg will do the rest: download and
validate source files, check dependencies, configure the build-time settings,
build the package, install the package into a temporary root, make
customizations, generate meta-info, and package the whole thing up for pacman
to use.

NOTE: makepkg uses your current locale by default and does not unset it when
building packages. If you wish to share your build output with others when
seeking help or for other purposes, you may wish to run "`LC_ALL=C makepkg`" so
your logs and output are not localized.

Options
-------
*\--asroot*::
	Allow makepkg to run as root. This is for security purposes as it is
	normally dangerous to do so. This will also disable use of fakeroot and
	sudo.

*-A, \--ignorearch*::
	Ignore a missing or incomplete arch field in the build script. This is
	for rebuilding packages from source when the PKGBUILD may be slightly
	outdated and not updated with an `$$arch=('yourarch')$$` field.

*-c, \--clean*::
	Clean up leftover work files and directories after a successful build.

*-C, \--cleancache*::
	Removes all cached source files from the directory specified in `SRCDEST`
	in linkman:makepkg.conf[5].

*-d, \--nodeps*::
	Do not perform any dependency checks. This will let you override and
	ignore any dependencies required. There is a good chance this option
	will break the build process if all of the dependencies are not
	installed.

*-e, \--noextract*::
	Do not extract source files; use whatever source already exists in the
	src/ directory. This is handy if you want to go into src/ and manually
	patch or tweak code, then make a package out of the result. Keep in mind
	that creating a patch may be a better solution to allow others to use
	your PKGBUILD.

*-f, \--force*::
	makepkg will not build a package if a built package already exists in
	the `PKGDEST` (set in linkman:makepkg.conf[5]) directory, which may
	default to the current directory. This allows the built package to be
	overwritten.

*--forcever*::
	This is a hidden option that should *not* be used unless you really know
	what you are doing. makepkg uses this internally when calling itself to
	set the new development pkgver of the package.

*-g, \--geninteg*::
	For each source file in the source array of PKGBUILD, download the file
	if required and generate integrity checks. The integrity checks
	generated are determined by the value of the INTEGRITY_CHECK array in
	linkman:makepkg.conf[5]. This output can be redirected into your
	PKGBUILD for source validation using "`makepkg -g >> PKGBUILD`".

*-h, \--help*::
	Output syntax and command line options.

*\--holdver*::
	Useful when building development versions of packages. Prevents makepkg
	from automatically bumping the pkgver to the latest revision number in
	the package's development tree.

*-i, \--install*::
	Install or upgrade the package after a successful build using
	linkman:pacman[8].

*-L, \--log*::
	Enable makepkg build logging. This will use the *tee* program to send
	output of the `build()` function to both the console and to a text file in
	the build directory named `pkgname-pkgver-pkgrel-arch.log`. As mentioned
	above, the build log will be localized so you may want to set your locale
	accordingly if sharing the log output with others.

*-m, \--nocolor*::
	Disable color in output messages.

*-o, \--nobuild*::
	Download and extract files only, but do not build them. Useful with the
	`\--noextract` option if you wish to tweak the files in src/ before
	building.

*-p* <`buildscript`>::
	Read the package script `buildscript` instead of the `PKGBUILD` default;
	see linkman:PKGBUILD[5].

*-r, \--rmdeps*::
	Upon successful build, remove any dependencies installed by makepkg
	during dependency auto-resolution and installation when using `-s`.

*-R, \--repackage*::
	Repackage contents of pkg/ without rebuilding the package. This is
	useful if you forgot a depend or install file in your PKGBUILD and the
	build itself will not change.

*-s, \--syncdeps*::
	Install missing dependencies using pacman. When build-time or run-time
	dependencies are not found, pacman will try to resolve them. If
	successful, the missing packages will be downloaded and installed.

*\--allsource*::
	Do not actually build the package, but build a source-only tarball that
	includes all sources, including those that are normally download via
	makepkg. This is useful for passing a single tarball to another program
	such as a chroot or remote builder. It will also satisfy requirements of
	the GPL when distributing binary packages.

*\--source*::
	Do not actually build the package, but build a source-only tarball that
	does not include sources that can be fetched via a download URL. This is
	useful for passing a single tarball to another program such as a chroot,
	remote builder, or a tarball upload.

*\--noconfirm*::
	(Passed to pacman) Prevent pacman from waiting for user input before
	proceeding with operations.

*\--noprogressbar*::
	(Passed to pacman) Prevent pacman from displaying a progress bar;
	useful if you are redirecting makepkg output to file.


Additional Features
-------------------
makepkg supports building development versions of packages without having to
manually update the pkgver in the PKGBUILD. This was formerly done using the
separate utility 'versionpkg'. See linkman:PKGBUILD[5] for details on how to
set up a development PKGBUILD.


Configuration
-------------
See linkman:makepkg.conf[5] for more details on configuring makepkg using the
'makepkg.conf' file.
