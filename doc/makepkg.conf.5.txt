Name
----
makepkg.conf - makepkg configuration file


Synopsis
--------
{sysconfdir}/makepkg.conf, ~/.makepkg.conf


Description
-----------
Configuration options for makekpg are stored in makepkg.conf. This file is
sourced, so you can include any special compiler flags you wish to use. This is
helpful for building for different architectures, or with different
optimizations. However, only the variables described below are exported to the
build environment.

NOTE: This does not guarantee that all package Makefiles will use your exported
variables. Some of them are non-standard.

The default file is fairly well commented, so it may be easiest to simply
follow directions given there for customization.


Options
-------
**DLAGENTS=(**\'protocol::/path/to/command [options]' ...**)**::
	Sets the download agents used to fetch source files specified with a URL in
	the linkman:PKGBUILD[5] file. Options can be specified for each command as
	well, and any protocol can have a download agent. Several examples are provided
	in the default makepkg.conf.
	+
	If present, `%u` will be replaced with the download URL. Otherwise, the
	download URL will be placed on the end of the command. If present, `%o` will
	be replaced with the local filename, plus a ``.part'' extension, which allows
	makepkg to handle resuming file downloads.

**CARCH=**"carch"::
	Specifies your computer architecture; possible values include such things
	as ``i686'', ``x86_64'', ``ppc'', etc. This should be automatically set on
	installation.

**CHOST=**"chost"::
	A string such as ``i686-pc-linux-gnu'', do not touch unless you know what
	you are doing. This can be commented out by most users if desired.

**CFLAGS=**"cflags"::
	Flags used for the C compiler. This is a key part to the use of makepkg.
	Usually several options are specified, and the most common string resembles
	something like this: ``-march=i686 -O2 -pipe''. Another useful option may
	be `-mcpu` in place of `-march`. Read gcc(1) for more details on the wide
	variety of compiler flags available.

**CXXFLAGS=**"cxxflags"::
	Flags used for the C++ compiler; see CFLAGS for more info.

**MAKEFLAGS=**"makeflags"::
	This is often used to set the number of jobs used, for example, `-j2`.
	Other flags that make accepts can also be passed.

**BUILDENV=(**fakeroot !distcc color !ccache !xdelta**)**::
	This array contains options that affect the build environment, the defaults
	are shown here. All options should always be left in the array; to enable
	or disable an option simply remove or place an ``!'' at the front of the
	option. Each works as follows:

	*fakeroot*;;
		Allow building packages as a non-root user. This is highly recommended.

	*distcc*;;
		Use the distributed C/C++/ObjC compiler to spread compilation among
		multiple machines. If this is enabled, `DISTCC_HOSTS` must be specified
		as well.

	*color*;;
		Colorize output messages, making output easier to read.

	*ccache*;;
		Use ccache to cache compilation by default. This allows for faster
		compiles if you are continuously recompiling the same packages. It can
		be disabled for individual packages by placing `!ccache` in the
		PKGBUILD options array.

	*xdelta*;;
		Generate an xdelta binary patch from previous to current package. The
		previous package must be available in the makepkg cache directory for
		this to occur.

**DISTCC_HOSTS=**"host1 ..."::
	If using DistCC, this is used to specify a space-delimited list of hosts
	running in the DistCC cluster. In addition, you will want to modify your
	`MAKEFLAGS`.

**OPTIONS=(**strip docs libtool emptydirs zipman**)**::
	This array contains options that affect the default packaging. They are
	equivalent to options that can be placed in the PKGBUILD; the defaults are
	shown here. All options should always be left in the array; to enable or
	disable an option simply remove or place an ``!'' at the front of the
	option. Each works as follows:

	*strip*;;
		Strip symbols from binaries and libraries. If you frequently use a
		debugger on programs or libraries, it may be helpful to disable this
		option.

	*docs*;;
		Save doc and info directories. If you wish to delete doc and info
		directories, specify `!docs' in the array.

	*libtool*;;
		Leave libtool (.la) files in packages. Specify `!libtool' to remove
		them.

	*emptydirs*;;
		Leave empty directories in packages.

	*zipman*;;
		Compress man pages with gzip.

**INTEGRITY_CHECK=(**check1 ...**)**::
	File integrity checks to use. Multiple checks may be specified; this
	affects both generation and checking. The current valid options are:
	`md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha384`, and `sha512`.

**DOC_DIRS=(**usr/{,share/}{info,doc} ...**)**::
	If "!docs" is specified in the OPTIONS array, this variable will
	instruct makepkg where to look to remove docs. If you build packages
	that are located in opt/, you may need to add the directory to this
	array. *NOTE:* Do not add the leading slash to the directory name.

**STRIP_DIRS=(**bin lib sbin usr/{bin,lib} ...**)**::
	If "strip" is specified in the OPTIONS array, this variable will
	instruct makepkg where to look to for files to strip. If you build
	packages that are located in opt/, you may need to add the directory
	to this array. *NOTE:* Do not add the leading slash to the directory
	name.

**PKGDEST=**"/path/to/folder"::
	If this value is not set, packages will by default be placed in the
	current directory (location of the linkman:PKGBUILD[5]). Many people
	like to keep all their packages in one place so this option allows
	this behavior. A common location is ``/home/packages''.

**SRCDEST=**"/path/to/folder"::
	If this value is not set, downloaded source files will only be stored
	in the current directory. Many people like to keep all source files in
	a central location for easy cleanup, so this path can be set here.

**PACKAGER=**"John Doe <john@doe.com>"::
	This value is used when querying a package to see who was the builder.
	It is recommended you change this to your name and email address.

*BUILDSCRIPT*, *PKGEXT*, *SRCEXT*, *DB_COMPRESSION*, *DB_CHECKSUMS*::
	Do not touch these unless you know what you are doing.
