                our usual x.y.z
              - i18n fixes:

              - more verbose error messages for unsatisfied dependencies
2.9.99.5      - re-added SBU support to makepkg (which was accidently dropped
                by 2.9.99.0)
              - initial package splitting support

                that dependency
              - fix for segfaults that occurred when propagating requiredby
                fields to replaced packages where one package depended on
                another replaced package

              - changed license field to operate as an array, not a string
              - added more logic for file conflict checks - if one target
                is a file and the other is a directory, then it's a conflict
              - fixed the integrity check in pacman-optimize
              - reverted NoUpgrade to old behaviour and instead, added the
                NoExtract directive to pacman.conf, which prevents a file
                from ever being extracted on to the system
                 eg, NoExtract = home/httpd/html/index.html
2.9.6         - added a pacman-optimize script to try and defragment the DB
              - modified NoUpgrade behaviour to avoid extracting files
                that are missing from the filesystem -- this helps in
                situations where the admin does not want the file there, eg,
                remove index.html so index.php takes precedence
              - fixed a bug where files would sometimes go missing if they
                moved from one package to another
              - add db_remove() which is responsible for clearing out stale
                hash table entries when packages are removed
              - added ccache support to makepkg

                deps with --upgrade
              - added "Repository" line to -Si output
              - patch from Tommi Rantala to fix trim() behaviour with
                empty or whitespace-only strings
              - fixed removal order when using -Rc or -Rs
2.9.4         - fixed a bug that was introduced from another bugfix :-/
2.9.3         - fixed a couple manpage typos
              - added --ignore to -S operations, works just like IgnorePkg
              - respect IgnorePkg list when pulling in dependencies
              - numerous memleak fixes
              - some code changes to improve customizability/branding
              - Makefile fix for nonstandard lib search paths (Kevin Piche)
              - fixed the leftover directories in /tmp
              - speed improvement patches from Tommi Rantala
2.9.2         - bugfix for 2.9.1 
2.9.1         - --refresh now only downloads fresh packages lists if they've
                been updated (currently only works with FTP)
2.9           - Improved -Rs functionality -- pacman now tracks why a package
                is installed: explicitly, or as a dependency for another
                package.  -Rs will only remove dependencies that were not
                explicitly installed.
              - Added compressed package size to sync DBs -- shows the total
                size of packages before downloading
              - Patch from Tommi Rantala:
                - Allow --info and --list together in queries
              - Patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Use list_add_sorted() with -Sg
              - Patch from Hegedus Marton Csaba:
                - Better manpage compression
              - Added checks for additional hyphens in package versions
              - mktemp was failing if %pmo_root%/tmp was missing -- fixed
2.8.4         - Added updatesync script from Jason Chu
              - Changed the pacman binary to be dynamically linked
                - Included a pacman.static binary as well
                - Added fakeroot checks when seeing if we're root
              - Fixed makepkg to use 'tail -n 1' instead of 'tail -1'
              - Added patch from Kevin Piche:
                - Cleanup db_loadpkgs(), add list_add_sorted()
              - Fixed a memory leak in db_find_conflicts()
2.8.3         - Fixed a little makepkg bug with bash 3.0
              - Fixed resolvedeps to always prefer literals over provisios
              - Added --config option to specify an alternate config file
              - Added "Include" directive to include repositories from
                config files (inspired by Michael Baehr's patch)
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Even smarter file-conflict checking
2.8.2         - Fixed a segfault bug in file-conflict checks
              - Made --noconfirm actually work.  Go me.
2.8.1         - Added a HoldPkg option in pacman.conf, for the more
                exploratory users who run things like "pacman -R pacman".  It
                will ask for confirmation before removing any packages listed
                in the HoldPkg list
              - Added a --noconfirm switch for use with script automation
              - Modified dependency resolution to prefer packages explicitly
                requested on the cmdline instead of those pulled in by
                resolvedeps().  Example, if neither "xorg" nor "xfree86" is
                installed and "blackbox xfree86" is requested, "xfree86" will
                be used instead of "xorg"
              - Added patch from Jason Chu:
                - Smarter file-conflict checking with symlinked paths and
                  with files that move from one package to another

              - added -Qs option (bug #854)
              - a provisio does not imply conflict, to make a provisio target
                conflict with anything else that provides the same thing, you
                can now do this by specifying the provisio target as both a
                provides and a conflict, eg:
                   conflicts=('x-server')
                   provides=('x-server')

              - found an out-dated reference to /usr/abs, fixed
              - added a --recursive option for package removal, which removes
                all deps of a target that aren't required by other packages
2.7.4         - fixed a bug in conflict handling, where installing a
                conflicting package would fail even if the new package
                "provided" it
              - if pacman sees a newer version of itself during an upgrade,
                it will ask to install itself first, then be re-run to upgrade
                the other packages.
              - You can now use the --info option with --sync to display an

                - fixed a bug with list_merge()
                - fixed some MLK (in dumppkg() and with "-Qi --orphans")

              - Fixed an argument-passing bug in fakeroot
              - Modified pacman's behaviour wrt provides -- it now allows
                multiple packages to be installed, even if they provide the
                same thing (they were treated as conflicts before)
2.6           - Added group handling, so one can run 'pacman -S kde' and

                can now either A) download/install missing deps with pacman
